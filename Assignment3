You have deployed an application, that is listening at port 8000.
You used a replica-set to deploy it and created a NodePort service to make it accessible. 
But when you test it, somehow the application is not reachable at the port.
Write down your approach and sequentially all the steps that you will take to find out the issue.

need to check nodeport using "kubectl get svc".
Then in the browser enter <ip-address of node:nodeport> to access it.
Even then if application is not reachable , then delete pod using "kubectl delete po <podname>"
New Pod will be created as it is a replicaset.
Now access it in the browser enter <ip-address of node:nodeport>
